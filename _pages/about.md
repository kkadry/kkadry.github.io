I am a PhD student at the [Edelman Lab](https://edelmanlab.mit.edu/), advised by Dr. Elazer Edelman. My research revolves around integrating computational tools into clinical workflows to understand coronary artery disease and guide cardiovascular interventions. I specifically leverage techniques from computational mechanics, biomedical computer vision, image registration, and generative AI.
