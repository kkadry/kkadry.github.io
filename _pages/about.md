Website Under Construction.


I am a third-year PhD student at the [Edelman Lab](https://edelmanlab.mit.edu/), advised by Dr. Elazer Edelman. I have a M.Sc in Bioengineering from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sv/) and a dual bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and Physics from the [American University in Cairo](https://www.aucegypt.edu/). My research involves integrating computational tools into clinical workflows to understand coronary artery disease and guide cardiovascular interventions. To do this, I leverage techniques from computational mechanics, biomedical computer vision, image registration, and generative AI.
